### Cookfile Format v1.5.0

Introduced with v1.3.5 of PiFire, the cookfile format saves information about a cook from start to finish.  The file includes metadata, history data, labels, events, comments, and assets (images).  This page will provide the technical details, such that others can utilize the same formatting in their software.  I'm providing this specification and making it freely available so that anyone can adopt it for their project or production product.  

```danger
This specification, and contents are currently under development and may be updated periodically to improve accuracy and information.  
```

#### New with v1.5.0

The following changes were made to the file format in v1.5.0:
1. **graph_data.json** - The format for this file has been completely changed and now contains data structures that can be directly used by the chartjs to render the chart. 
2. **graph_labels.json** - The format for this file has been changed to accomodate updates to the latest PiFire, giving much more flexibility to the number and types of probes available.  
3. **raw_data.json** - This file has been added to the structure which is a raw dump of the data that PiFire stores in it's own database while running.  This file may contain extended data and 'Aux' probes that aren't displayed in the UI.  This is the data used when selecting a CSV export from the graph card in the cookfile UI of PiFire.  

#### Compression

PiFire uses the standard pyzipfile module to compress and decompress files with the '.pifire' extension.  PiFire uses the standard ZIP compression method (using zip_deflated option in the python module).  

#### Structure 
In broad strokes, the cookfile is a compressed zip formatted folder of files.  The structure of the file looks like this:

```
/
+ metadata.json 
+ events.json
+ graph-data.json
+ graph-labels.json
+ raw-data.json 
+ comments.json
+ assets.json

/assets
    + asset_01.jpg
    + asset_02.jpg
    ...
    + asset_nn.jpg

    /thumbs
        + asset_01.jpg
        + asset_02.jpg
        ...
        + asset_nn.jpg
```

The assets listed in the asset folder and thumbs folder are examples only and represent image files that may be present in the cookfile.  

#### Metadata

The metadata file stores the information about the file and general information about the cook. The format is as follows:

```json
{
  "endtime": 1665881268061,
  "id": "298e46ec-4cec-11ed-a4e6-b827eb4fc611",
  "starttime": 1665861135559,
  "thumbnail": "4a0c0a1d-4d01-11ed-9781-b827eb4fc60e.jpg",
  "title": "Beef Ribs",
  "units": "F",
  "version": "1.0.1"
}
```

* __endtime__: Time the cook ended.  (unix time) [Required]
* __id__: This is a randomly generated UUID for the file.  Some effort should be taken to ensure this is a unique ID so that it does not conflict with other files on the same system or other systems.  [Required]
* __starttime__: Time the cook started.  (unix time)  [Required]
* __thumbnail__: Filename of the thumbnail image for the cookfile.  Used to display on the file list and in the cookfile viewer.  If a filename is present, it should exist in the /assets/thumbnails/ folder.  Thumbnail may be empty but tag must be present. [Optional]
* __title__: Title/Name for the cookfile.  Default will match the filename which is in the format "YYYY-MM-DD--HHMM-Cookfile". Title can be empty but tag must be present. [Optional]
* __units__: Temperature units in either C (Celcius) or F (Farenheit). [Required] 
* __version__ : The version level of the cookfile.  This is intended to allow for backward compatibility with older cook file formats in the future. [Required]  

#### Events

The events file contains details for each of the stages of a particular cook, from startup to shutdown/stop.  The following is an example. 

```json
[
  {
    "auger_cycle_time": 15,
    "augerontime": 75.83552360534668,

    "starttime_c": "17:47:49",
    "startup_temp": 0,
    "timeinmode": "NA"
  }
]
```

The above file consists of an __ordered__ list of events in a JSON structure.  Each event is a 'mode' which would have some kind of metrics associated with it.  The events/modes should be in order, with Startup or Prime as the beginning and Stop being the last mode such as:

1. Startup
2. Smoke
3. Hold
4. Shutdown
5. Stop

Each of these modes would have a block with metrics like the above.  The metrics listed above are the ones that PiFire will keep during a cook, but more may be added in future versions. 

* **auger_cycle_time:** Integer indicating fixed auger cycle time in seconds.  This value may be zero in certain modes (i.e. Hold, Shutdown, etc.)
* **augerontime:** Float indicating the amount of time the auger was enabled/on in seconds.  This value may be zero in certain modes. 
* **augerontime_c:** String converted from the augerontime seconds value. So that this number can be displayed nicely in the WebUI. 
* **endtime:** Float timestamp for the event/mode endtime.
* **endtime_c:** String converted from endtime, displayed in "HH:MM:SS" format. 
* **estusage_i:** String of estimated pellet usage calculated using augerontime, in imperial format i.e. "1.34 pounds (21.48 ounces)". 
* **estusage_m:** String of estimated pellet usage calculated using augerontime, in metric format i.e. "609 grams".
* **fanontime:** Float of operational fan time in this mode.  Currently not implemented.  
* **fanontime_c:** String converted of operational fan time in this mode. Currently not implemented.   
* **grill_settemp:** Integer or Float of grill set temperature (if applicable) during this mode.  
* **id:** String unique id for this particular mode.  Used by the software if there are multiple repeated modes/events in the same sequence. 
* **mode:** String indicating the mode.  
* **p_mode:** Integer indicating p-mode (0-10), if applicable. 
* **pellet_brand_type:** String indicating the pellet brand & type.  (i.e. "Bear Mountain Gourmet")
* **pellet_level_end:** Integer indicating the pellet level, in percent, at the end of this mode.  
* **pellet_level_start:** Integer indicating the pellet level, in percent, at the start of this mode.  
* **smart_start_profile:** Integer indication the Smart Start Profile selected, if applicable, for this mode.  
* **smokeplus:** Boolean indicating whether Smoke Plus feature is enabled.  'true' for enabled, 'false' for disabled.  
* **starttime:** Float timestamp for the event/mode start time. 
* **starttime_c:** String converted from starttime, displayed in "HH:MM:SS" format. 
* **startup_temp:** Integer or Float that indicates the ambient startup temperature (used to select smart-start)
* **timeinmode:** String calculated time in mode using endtime - starttime. 

#### Graph Labels

```note
This file is not currently being utilized in the latest version of PiFire and may be depricated or merged into the graph_data.json file.  
```

The graph_labels file provides a mapping of probe names to the probe labels for the data.  The below is an example of how this is formatted:

```json
{
  "primarysp": {
    "Grill": "Grill Set Point"
  },
  "probes": {
    "Grill": "Grill",
    "Probe1": "Probe-1",
    "Probe2": "Probe-2"
  },
  "targets": {
    "Grill": "Grill Target",
    "Probe1": "Probe-1 Target",
    "Probe2": "Probe-2 Target"
  }
}
```

The required fields are as follows:

* **primarysp:** Label/Friendly Name for the primary set point data set. 
* **probes:** Label/Friendly Name for all graphed probes including the primary probe.   
* **targets:** Label/Friendly Name for all graphed probes targets including the primary probe.   

#### Graph Data

These files contain information to help reconstruct a graph of the cook, using data from each of the probes. This file format was updated in v1.5 and now contains datastructures that can be directly consumed by chartjs for easier page rendering.  

The below is an abbreviated version of the file.   

```note

Removed due to an issue with Jekyll. 

```

There are three sections to the graph_data.json structure: 
1. 'chart_data' : This section contains the chart data for each of the probes, setpoint for the primary probe, and notification targets for all probes formatted for chartjs.  This section can be directly plugged into the 'datasets' portion of the chartjs object. [More information can be found here in the Chartjs documentation.](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html)
2. 'probe_mapper' : This section contains the mapping to the list items in the chart_data.  From the example above, the 'probe1' temperature can be found at list item 3 (where the list starts from 0).  This is helpful for the WebUI javascript to edit specific datasets. 
3. 'time_labels' : This is the list of time labels that correspond to the probe datasets, which is directly used by chartjs, converting to a human readable timestamp.  

#### Raw Data

The raw_data.json file contains the raw data from the PiFire history database, which is collected when running.  It's formatted exactly how the data would be formatted in the database.  Each list item / line item, is all the data collected at that specific time time organized by probe and type.  

```json 
[
  {
    "AUX": {},
    "EXD": {
      "CR": 0.1875,
      "RCR": 0.1875
    },
    "F": {
      "Probe1": 208,
      "Probe2": 206
    },
    "NT": {
      "Grill": 0,
      "Probe1": 0,
      "Probe2": 0
    },
    "P": {
      "Grill": 466
    },
    "PSP": 0,
    "T": 1674255152444
  },
  {
    "AUX": {},
    "EXD": {
      "CR": 0.1875,
      "RCR": 0.1875
    },
    "F": {
      "Probe1": 208,
      "Probe2": 207
    },
    "NT": {
      "Grill": 0,
      "Probe1": 0,
      "Probe2": 0
    },
    "P": {
      "Grill": 465
    },
    "PSP": 0,
    "T": 1674255155486
  },
  ...
]
```

Each item in the list is broken into sections:

- 'T' - Timestamp of when the data was sampled 
- 'P' - Dictionary of Primary probe temperatures formatted: 'label' : temperature  
  - **NOTE:** Currently only one primary probe is supported by PiFire, so there should only be one label/value pair.  
- 'PSP' - Primary Set Point Temperature
- 'F' - Dictionary of Food probe temperatures formatted: 'label' : temperature
- 'NT' - Dictionary of Notification Targets, used to track target for notification for each probe.  This should include both food probes and the primary probe.  This is formatted: 'label' : temperature
- 'AUX' - Dictionary of Auxilliary probe temperatures formatted: 'label' : temperature
  - **NOTE** - Auxilliary probes are not intended to be displayed on the graph and are to be used by virtual probes, or are just for capturing extra data.  
- 'EXD' - Dictionary of Extended Data values.  This can contain any number of key : value pairs, and can be used to store extra data used for debug, etc.  

#### Comments

The comments file is used to store comments and notes about the cook.  Examples of usages could be to store recipe information, specific details about cooking, how well it turned out, including images of the cook.  This file may contain an empty list if no comments are added. (i.e. '[]')  

```json
[
  {
    "assets": [
      "6b809ae7-4d01-11ed-b360-b827eb4fc638.jpg",
      "7ca54370-4d01-11ed-bded-b827eb4fc5f9.jpg"
    ],

    "text": "A little disappointing in the final product.  Decent flavor, minimal meat and extremely chewy membrane.  It all looked great, but the texture wasn't my favorite.  Probably won't be doing these again.  ",
    "time": "20:22"
  },
  {
    "assets": [],
    "date": "2022-10-15",
    "edited": "",
    "id": "24ac3854-4d02-11ed-9420-b827eb4fc613",
    "text": "1. Started with a long smoke at 185F (spraying occasionally with a mixture of apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, Tapatio sauce)\n2. After internal temperature reached approximately 160F, wrapped meat side down (with sauce) and bumped temperature to 250F\n3. Finished last half an hour at 350F",
    "time": "20:25"
  }
]
```

* **assets:** List of strings of filenames, of the images that are to be displayed with this comment.  These images and their corresponding thumbnail images must be in the '/assets' and '/assets/thumbnails' folders.  
* **date:** String of the date that the comment was first entered. Format "YYYY-MM-DD".
* **edited:** String of the date that the comment was edited last in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM". 
* **id:** Unique ID for the comment. 
* **text:** Raw string of the comment itself.  The string can include line breaks with the '\n' null character.
* **time:** String of the time the comment was first entered.  Format "HH:MM".  

#### Assets

The assets file stores pointers to all of the asset (image) files in the assets folder.  If there are no assets in this cookfile, the list may be empty (i.e. '[]').  Here is an example of the format.  

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "4a0c0a1d-4d01-11ed-9781-b827eb4fc60e.jpg",
    "id": "4a0c0a1d-4d01-11ed-9781-b827eb4fc60e",
    "type": "jpg"
  },
  {
    "filename": "6b809ae7-4d01-11ed-b360-b827eb4fc638.jpg",
    "id": "6b809ae7-4d01-11ed-b360-b827eb4fc638",
    "type": "jpg"
  },
  {
    "filename": "7ca54370-4d01-11ed-bded-b827eb4fc5f9.jpg",
    "id": "7ca54370-4d01-11ed-bded-b827eb4fc5f9",
    "type": "jpg"
  }
]
```

* **filename:** String of the filename for the asset/media that is stored in the '/assets' folder.  [Required]
* **id:** String of the unique id assigned to this asset.  [Required]
* **type:** String of the filetype for this asset.  [Required]

Others notes about assets/media stored in the file.  

```note
Image files added to the cookfile are rotated, resized (800x600 maximum size) and converted to JPEG format by PiFire automatically.  When images are added to PiFire, they will automatically have a 128x128 thumbnail created, and added to the '/assets/thumbnails/' folder with a corresponding name.
```
